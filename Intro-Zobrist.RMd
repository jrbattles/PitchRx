## Background Information

Ben "Zorilla" Zobrist is a man to be reckoned with.  In the final game of the world series, he stepped up to the plate with runners on first and second and one out. He hit a double to left field that scored a runner and gave the Cubs a 7-6 lead. His heroics helped the Cubs seal the game and earned him World Series MVP honors.




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
